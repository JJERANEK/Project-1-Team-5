# Proposal
Our project is to determine if it is more lucrative to live in the Twin Cities Metro area or Greater Minnesota based on the ration of wages to cost of living. We'll look at trends in housing and wage data over time; income to expense ratios for each economic development region (EDR) of Minnesota; and compare our finidings for Minnesota to Ohio to see if another state produces similar results.

# Comparitive Analysis
Is it more lucrative to live in the Twin Cities Metro area or Greater Minnesota?

  * Twin Cities Metro Area vs Greater Minnesota
  * Comparison vs Ohio's Greater & Metro Areas

### Questions:
 * What is the average income to expenses ratio for each economic development regions of Minnesota and how do they compare to each other? 
 * How does the change in average income compare with the change in housing prices in these areas over time? 
 * Does the data we find for Minnesota hold true for Ohio?

# Our Project
 * Determine project idea. What is our main question, with follow-up topics. Initial topic questions were formed to help answer our main question.
 * Determine our data sources, and worked to narrow our scope down.
 * Use Python to extrapolate the data.
 * Use Pandas to clean and format the data.
 * Created Jupyter Notebooks to describe the data exploration and cleanup process.
 * Created a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the ﬁnal data analysis.
 * Use Matplotlib to create charts.
 * Used an API, to pull data.
 * Create a write-up summarizing our major ﬁndings.
