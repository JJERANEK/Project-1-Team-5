# Project-1-Team-5

# Proposal Update

Our project is to determine if it is more lucrative to live in the Twin Cities Metro area or Greater Minnesota based on the ration of wages to cost of living. We'll look at trends in housing and wage data over time; income to expense ratios for each economic development region (EDR) of Minnesota; and compare our finidings for Minnesota to Ohio to see if another state produces similar results.

### Questions:
- What is the average income to expenses ratio for each economic development regions of Minnesota and how do they compare to each other?
- How does the change in average income compare with the change in housing prices in these areas over time?
- Does the data we find for Minnesota hold true for Ohio?
